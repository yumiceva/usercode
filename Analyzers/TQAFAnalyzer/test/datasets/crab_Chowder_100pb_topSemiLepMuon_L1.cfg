### RETRIEVE JOB OUTPUT INTO UI ###
## to have back the job executable output into UI (return_data= 1)
return_data = 1

### If return_data = 1 ###
## UI directory where to store the CMS executable output
## FULL path is mandatory. If none <ui_working_dir>/res will be used.

### If return_data = 1 ###
## UI directory where to store the stderr, stdout and .BrokerInfo of submitted jobs
## FULL path is mandatory. If none <ui_working_dir>/res will be used.
#logdir=/home/fanzago/CRAB/UserTools/src/grid_job_log

### COPY JOB OUTPUT INTO A SE ###
## if you want to copy the CMS executable output into a SE (i:e castor)
### WARNING: if the copy fails and return_data = 0, the output is lost
copy_data = 0

### if copy_data = 1 ###

### REGISTER JOB OUTPUT IN THE LFC CATALOG ###
## if you want also to register the CMS executable output into the LFC catalog
## WARNING: to use with copy_data = 1
#register_data = 1

### if register_data = 1
## If you register the CMS output file into the LFC catalog, this is the first part of LFN
### example LFN="lfn_dir"/"output_file"
