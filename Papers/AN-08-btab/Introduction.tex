\section{Introduction}

The measurement of the b-tagging performance using a sample of muon-in-jets is described
in the CMS Analysis Note~\cite{ref:btag_oldnote}. Three methods were
studied in detail in Ref.~\cite{ref:btag_oldnote}: System8, $p_{Trel}$,
and counting. The System8 method is based in the use of two weakly correlated
b-taggers and two sets of a muon-in-jet sample. One sample is a subset of the
muon-in-jet sample where an away-jet is tagged as a b-jet. The correlations
between the two b-taggers and between the two samples are estimated
from Monte Carlo (MC). The flavor contributions are written for 
each combination of sample and tagger producing a system of eight
equations. The results of the system-of-equation are the
efficiencies and c+light mistagging 
for the two tagger applied on the samples. 

This note describes the improvements developed since the analysis in Ref.~\cite{ref:btag_oldnote}. The analysis was done using the CMSSW 1.6.X release and the
CSA07 samples.
