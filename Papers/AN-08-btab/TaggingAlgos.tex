\section{Tagging algorithms and Operating Points}
\label{sec:taggingalgos}
Several algorithms to identify jets originating from 
the decay of a $b$ quark are available in CMSSW. The ones considered in this 
analysis rely on the extended lifetime of B hadrons. In particular, the 
TrackCounting and the JetProbability taggers rely on tracks with large impact 
parameters with respect to the interaction point. 

The TrackCounting tagger (TC) computes the 3D impact parameter significance 
$IP/\sigma_{IP}$ for each selected track in a jet with respect to
the primary vertex. The jet is tagged as a 
$b$ jet if the number of tracks with an $IP/\sigma_{IP}$ exceeding a given 
cut is greater than a value which can be optimized for high efficiency or
high purity in the resulting sample. Tracks are ordered in decreasing 
impact parameter significance $IP/\sigma_{IP}$. The significance of the track
impact parameter of the $N_{th} $ track serves as the discriminator for this 
algorithm.
In this note, two discriminants were chosen for the TrackCounting tagger by 
requiring second ($TCHE$) or third ($TCHP$) track with a 3D $IP/\sigma_{IP}$ 
larger than a given cut.

The JetProbability tagger (JP) is also based on track impact parameter:
it computes how likely it is for a set of tracks to have originated from the 
primary vertex, based on the $IP/\sigma_{IP}$ of each track in a jet. 

Figure ~\ref{fig:Performance_plots} shows the tagging efficiencies for $c$ and 
light jets as a funcion of the efficiency to tag a $b$ jet, as measured  
using the Monte Carlo truth information to identify the flavour of a 
particular jet in the QCD $80<\hat{p_T}<120\;{\rm GeV}/c$ sample. 

Based on this study, three operating points are defined that select 
an average fraction of approximately 10\%, 1\% or 0.1\%, 
respectively, of $udsg$ tagged jets in the QCD 80-120 sample.
Table~\ref{tab:OperatingPoints} summarizes 
the definition of the operating points.
