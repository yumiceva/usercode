\section{Selection Criteria and Simulation Datasets}
\label{sec:samples}

This study is based on three different Monte Carlo samples denoted QCD, 
inclusive $t\bar{t}+0$jets and $pp\rightarrow \mu +X$. The QCD sample 
was generated in different $\hat{p}_T $ bins at generator level. All
samples were generated with PYTHIA, except for the $t\bar{t} $ sample 
that was generated with ALPGEN. All samples were simulated with 
CMSSW\_1\_4\_X and reconstructed with CMSSW\_1\_5\_2 as part of the CSA07
production. The $pp\rightarrow \mu +X $ sample is QCD minbias events with
muon $p_T > 3 $.

The analysis is based on samples that have at least two reconstructed jets 
and a non-isolated muon close to one of the jets. The jets are reconstructed 
using the iterativeCone5 algorithm and corrected by a generator to 
reconstruction calibration factor. The jets and the muons in the event are
selected using the criteria described in the CMS Analysis 
Note~\cite{ref:btag_oldnote}.

Two samples are used in the analysis, defined as follows:
\begin{itemize} 
\item The  muon-in-jet+away-jet sample contains two reconstructed jets
and a non-isolated muon with $\Delta R(\mu,{\rm jet})<0.4$. In case 
more than one muon is found within a cone of $\Delta R<0.4$ of the jet, the 
muon with the highest $p_T$ is taken. For this study, the jet containing the 
muon will be denoted ``muon-jet",  and the other jet will be denoted the 
``away-jet''. If in a given event both jets contain muons, both will be 
counted as muon-jet. 
\item The muon-in-jet+tagged-away-jet sample is a subset of the 
muon-in-jet+away-jet sample, where the away-jet is tagged as a $b$ jet. 
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:samples} summarizes the samples used, and the number 
of events avilable.
For muon-jets the \ptrel is defined as the transverse momentum of the muon 
relative to the direction of the total muon-jet momentum vector, 
\begin{equation}
p_{Trel}=\frac{p^{\mu} \times p^{\mu + {\rm jet}}}{|p^{\mu + {\rm jet}}|}.
\end{equation}
