\section{Summary and Conclusions}


 The System8 method has been extended to consider correlations for the soft
muon tagger. We now have a better convergence range in jet $p_T$ as compared 
to the previous analysis~\cite{ref:btag_oldnote}. Along with
the b-tagging efficiency we also measred the charm+light jet tagging 
efficiency using the System8 method. The method was applied to the 
$pp\rightarrow \mu +X$, $t\bar{t}+0$~jets and QCD samples for the three 
operating points of the Track Counting and the Track Probability tagger and the
Soft Lepton tagger. The average solutions from System8 are in good 
agreement with the expected efficiencies obtained from the MC truth information.
The b-tag efficiency has been measured as a function of jet $p_T$ using a coarse
binning in $p_T$ for the $pp\rightarrow \mu +X$ sample. The agreement between 
the measured and expected b-tag efficiency from MC truth is good for the Track 
Counting and Soft Lepton taggers, but the agreement is not very good for the 
Jet Probability tagger for the loose and medium operating points. We beleive
the reason for this disagreement is that the $pp\rightarrow \mu +X$ sample
 has a lower number of light jets so the correlation factors for 
light jets have large uncertainty, and the Jet Probability tagger seems to
be  more
sensible to this effect.

 We would like to incorporate some improvements/revisions into the Performance 
measurement package like cross-checking that we use the muon with the highest 
$p_T$ to calculate the pTrel, improving the muon identification, 
using a muon trigger, and try to get rid of the tiny contamination from other 
processes with a muon-in-jet like the $J/\Psi $ and charm quark decay.
