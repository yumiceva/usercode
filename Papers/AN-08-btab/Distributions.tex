\section{Distributions of the Muon $p_T$ with
respect to the muon+jet axis ($p_{Trel}$)}

This section shows several distribution of the $p_{Trel}$ variable
for the samples of inclusive QCD, muon enriched QCD, and $t\bar{t}+0$jets.
Additional distributions of the $p_{Trel}$ for different
thresholds of jet and muon $p_T$, flavor of the jet, $\Delta R$ of the
muon with respect to the jet are shown in the Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix} 
section.

Figure~\ref{fig:jet_ptrel_all_qcd} shows the $p_{Trel}$ distributions
for each parton flavor (b, charm, and udsg) for the inclusive QCD sample.
A similar distribution for the muon enriched sample is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:jet_ptrel_all_muX}. In this case, a clear discrepancy in 
the distribution for light jets (udsg) can be observed compared with
the inclusive QCD sample. The reason for this discrepancy is that
the muon enriched sample has only prompt muons coming from the primary
vertex. Muons from pion and kaon decays are not included in this
sample which changes dramatically the shape of the $p_{Trel}$ distribution
for light jets. Figure~\ref{fig:jet_ptrel_all_ttbar} shows the 
$p_{Trel}$ distribution from the $t\bar{t}+0$~jet sample.
